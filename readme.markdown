# ArduinoGateway: Public Gateway for an Arduino Device Network

The ArduinoGateway was created to provide a single and safe point of access from the web to multiple Arduino devices connected to a single node via a local area network or serial connections (including bluetooth and eventually xbees). Currently, this project is still in an initial phase of development.
